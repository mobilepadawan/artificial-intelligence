## Main objective

This application will aspire to get a chat application which can interact via chat text messages also using the voice. When you'll use the voice to send answers the chat will respond you via the same way, using the voice synthesis.

### Tools
For the chat response using the vice synthesis, this app integrates the [Speakit-JS JavaScript Library](https://github.com/mobilepadawan/Speakit-JS).

# Phrase-It

This projects invites you to play a while pronouncing some phrases in english. You should use the microphone to get the WebApp hears you and returns a punctuation about your pronounciation level percentage.

## Tools used

This WebApp is using `SpeechRecognition API`, `SpeechGrammarList API` and `SpeechRecognitionEvent API`. In all cases these are native tools included in JavaScript from many years ago.

### Limitations

I tested this functionality just in MacOS. Google Chrome works fine, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox didn't work.

Among Edge and Chrome are using the same web browser engine, Edge on MacOS is limited in some Web API's funcionalities. This information can be found in the Help Support of Microsoft Edge for Developers website.

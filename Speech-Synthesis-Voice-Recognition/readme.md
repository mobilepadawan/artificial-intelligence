# Voice recognition and Speech Synthesis

I built an App where there is implemented voice recognition native also Speech Synthesis. This last one is working through Speakit-JS library.

## Malfunctioning

Voice Recognition is not working in the following web browsers:
* Safari browser
* Firefox browser
* Microsoft Edge for MacOS

This code is just for fun. In the coming weeks we will moving it to a serious web application.

## Animation
The animation integrated it works combining classic CSS animation properties over a DIV element and controlling the CSS animation start and end from JavaScript.

This animation is integrated with the `soundstart` and `soundend` events propper of `SpeechRecognition` object.

# Voice recognition and Speech Synthesis

I built an App where there is implemented voice recognition native also Speech Synthesis. This last one is working through Speakit-JS library.

## Malfunctioning

Voice Recognition is not working in the following web browsers:
* Safari browser
* Firefox browser
* Microsoft Edge for MacOS

This code is just for fun. In the coming weeks we will moving it to a serious web application.

## Animation
The animation integrated it works combining classic CSS animation properties over a DIV element and controlling the CSS animation start and end from JavaScript.

This animation is integrated with the `soundstart` and `soundend` events propper of `SpeechRecognition` object.

## Sounds
The MP3 sound files added to this project are downloaded from a free resource mp3 sound centre. There is no any intention to comercialize with those sounds and the use of them are limited for non commercial software projects. If you want to use this code for a commercial project, please change the mp3 sounds included here for sounds with a commercial license.

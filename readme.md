# A.I. web applications

## Face-Recognition API

This webapp uses the TensorFlow model to recognize faces and face expressions using a simple image picked up by your computer or mobile phone, also taking a pictura using the smartphone cam _(last feature is only for smartphones)_.

## Audio Chat app

This webapp is a simple chat app that interacts with a chatbot but also combines the power of speech synthesis, speech recognition and the ChatGPT API. This is built in a very alpha phase but I think it will be promising.

## Speech Recognition sample

This webappp uses the native Voice recognition API to use the microphone of your webapp to listen to the user talk. the webapp will transcript in realtime all the audio listened by the microphone and show on the HTML document the transcripted text.

A software tool very easy to use. It's not a JS Library just a voice recognition using the JavaScript native API.

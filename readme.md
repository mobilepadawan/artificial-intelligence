# A.I. web applications

## Face-Recognition API

This webapp uses the TensorFlow model to recognize faces and face expressions using a simple image picked up by your computer or mobile phone, also taking a pictura using the smartphone cam _(last feature is only for smartphones)_.

## Text to speech sample

This webapp uses a JS library built by me to take a text written by you or pasted from and origin, and listen to it audibly. This webapp use a JS library that extendes the SpeechSynthesis and SpeechSynthesisUtterance objects, both native in JS, simplyfing its functions in a couple of .methods.

## Speech Recognition sample

This webappp uses the native Voice recognition API to use the microphone of your webapp to listen to the user talk. the webapp will transcript in realtime all the audio listened by the microphone and show on the HTML document the transcripted text.

A software tool very easy to use. It's not a JS Library just a voice recognition using the JavaScript native API.
